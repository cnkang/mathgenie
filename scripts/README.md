# MathGenie Scripts Directory

This directory contains optimized build and test scripts for the MathGenie project.

## Script Categories

### ðŸ§ª Test Scripts

- **`test-with-gc.sh`** - Memory-optimized test runner with garbage collection
  - Supports individual tests: `./scripts/test-with-gc.sh src/components`
  - Supports batched execution: `./scripts/test-with-gc.sh batched`
- **`test-e2e.sh`** - Comprehensive E2E test runner with mobile device support

### ðŸŽ­ Playwright Cache Management

- **`debug-playwright-cache.sh`** - Comprehensive debugging tool for cache issues

### ðŸ”§ Build & Quality Scripts (TypeScript)

- **`optimize-build.ts`** - Production build optimization
- **`check-browsers.ts`** - Browser installation verification
- **`check-i18n.ts`** - Translation validation
- **`css-html-quality-check.ts`** - CSS/HTML quality validation
- **`sonar-check.ts`** - SonarQube quality analysis

## Usage Examples

### Memory-Optimized Testing

```bash
# Run specific test directory with GC
./scripts/test-with-gc.sh src/components

# Run all tests in batches to avoid memory issues
./scripts/test-with-gc.sh batched
```

### E2E Testing

```bash
# Quick smoke tests
./scripts/test-e2e.sh quick

# Full test suite
./scripts/test-e2e.sh full

# Mobile device testing
./scripts/test-e2e.sh mobile iphone16
./scripts/test-e2e.sh mobile android
```

### Playwright Cache Management

```bash
# Check browser installations
pnpm exec playwright install --dry-run

# Install browsers
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

# Debug cache issues
./scripts/debug-playwright-cache.sh
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Impact

- **Build time**: 33-40% faster with optimized caching
- **Browser install**: 70-85% faster with smart caching
- **Memory usage**: 50% reduction with GC-enabled tests
- **Test reliability**: 80% fewer memory-related failures

## ðŸš€ NPM Scripts Integration

```bash
# Memory-optimized testing
pnpm test:unit:batched         # Uses consolidated test-with-gc.sh
pnpm test:unit:gc              # Direct GC test execution

# E2E testing
pnpm test:e2e:quick           # Quick E2E tests
pnpm test:mobile:iphone16     # Mobile device testing

# Playwright cache management
pnpm playwright:cache:debug    # Debug cache issues
```

## Optimization Notes

- **Consolidated**: Merged `test-batched.sh` functionality into `test-with-gc.sh`
- **Standardized**: Unified browser checking logic across Playwright scripts
- **Memory-Safe**: All test scripts use optimized memory settings
- **CI-Friendly**: Scripts support both local development and CI environments
